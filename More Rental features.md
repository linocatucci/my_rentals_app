Hi Everyone!

I've been working on a full YelpCamp refactor. You can view my progress here and the source code here.

So far I've included the following features:

- CSS3 background animation on landing page
- Search with AJAX
- Campground location with Google Maps
- Campground cost
- Footer
- Home link in navigation
- Authentication flash messages
- Display time since post was created with Moment JS
- User profile
- Password reset

--------------

To do (these are extra and may not be added for awhile):
- Campground rating system (stars or likes?)
- Comment ranking (up/down votes)
- Image upload with Amazon S3
- Form validation
--------------


Update: I've begun creating slides/videos for each of the features. I'll update you all as they become available.

You can access them below:

- UI Improvements (login and signup, nav-bar, registration flash message)
